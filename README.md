# JavaScript and jQuery Standard Calculator

A web-based application which clones some of the basic features and functionality of the Windows operating system's built-in calculator. This project was built with JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and CSS.

Calculation History

## Reflection

When I started this project I wanted to make a simple calculator. After looking over some tutorials on youtube, I found a lot of the JavaScript calculators being made were easy to break (such as by typing repeated/wrong buttons) or otherwise prone to errors. In the end I decided to code my calculator based partially on some of the structure of the SimpliCode Calcuator, but then to modify it greatly by reproducing some of the functionality of the standard calculator found on the Windows operating system to ensure that users can't  circumvent or break the features as easily. 

Similar to the calculator found on the Windows operating system, a history screen is also included, which records the history of the simpler math operations. A two-line display is also provided.
